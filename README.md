# Continuous Evaluation System

## Overview

This project is a Continuous Evaluation System for managing and evaluating student marks. It allows users to add, update, and delete student marks, generate mark sheets, and produce reports on failing students and top scorers. The system supports operations such as generating marksheets for specific courses and semesters, updating individual marks, and producing failure reports.

## Features

- **Add Student Marks**: Enter and store marks for students, including class tests, sessional marks, and assignments.
- **Update Student Marks**: Modify existing marks for students based on roll number and course code.
- **Delete Student Marks**: Remove student marks from the system.
- **Generate Mark Sheet**: Produce a marksheet for a given course and semester.
- **Failure Report by Semester**: Generate a report of students who have failed (total marks below 40) in a specific semester.
- **Course Wise Top Scorers**: Generate a list of top scorers for a given course.

## Technologies Used

- **C++**: Programming language used for implementing the system's logic.
